For multipart features:

**What, where:**

* If a single label per feature part, then that label should be near the centroid for the largest part.
* If auto: also label extra parts that are above a certain size per the scale (zoom) of the map. (Can the label fit.)
* If every part: each part's label should be near its centroid.

**Big features:**

(measured in terms of page units)

* Add letter space to "spread" the type to match the size of the feature.

**Types of Features with Indeterminate Boundaries**

1. Named Marine Water Bodies - Hydrography - Must Nest, No Overlaps
2. Named Physiographic Features - Physiography - May Nest or Have Partial Overlaps
3. Named Islands and Island Chains and Groups - Physiography and Hydrography - Must Nest, No Overlaps
4. Neighborhoods and Districts, Vernacular Regions - Cultural and Transportation - May Nest or Have Partial Overlaps
5. Land Cover, Geology, Soils and Other Overlays - Overlays - No Overlaps

**Feature Geometry Types**

A set of seven feature types that are used to specify label classes and variations in label placement properties were developed. 

1. Long 
2. Long and Skinny 
3. Oblong 
4. Round
5. Snaky or Pronged 
6. Splotch 
7. Snaky or Pronged and Skinny

**Calculating feature geometry types:**

In order to create the information that is stored in these fields, a Python script was written and uses an ArcGIS 9.2 geoprocessing command called "GEOMETRY:HULLRECTANGLE". This command returns a string containing the eight coordinates of the MBR. With these coordinates the RatioL2W and MBRArea field values can be set. The values for the LabelType field are set based on the following pseudo-code logic:

If RatioL2W < 4 and MBRArea > 60% Label Type = "Roundish"

Elseif RatioL2W < 8 and MBRArea > 25% LabelType = "Oblong"

Elseif RatioL2W >= 8 and MBRArea > 10% LabelType = "Long"

Elseif RatioL2W >= 8 and MBRArea <= 10% LabelType = "Long and Skinny"

Else 

  If RatioL2W < 4 and MBRArea >= 20% Label type = "Splotch" 

  Elseif RatioL2W < 8 and MBRArea > 12% Label Type = "Snaky or Pronged" 

  Elseif RatioL2W < 8 and MBRArea <=12% Label Type = "Snaky or Pronged and Skinny"


This logic is essentially first determining whether the shape is round-ish, and if not, if it is oblong or long, and if not, if it is a splotch, or snaky or pronged. The specific thresholds may need to be tuned to spe- cific cartographic requirements.

**Label placement per feature type:**

1. Round-ish
	
	i.	Placement: Curved

	ii.	May overrun by 36 pts 

	iii.	Allow asymmetric overrun = true

	iv.	Char. Space = up to 200% 

	v.	Reduce font from 14 pts. to 10 pts. by 1 pt. increments 

2. Oblong 

	i. Placement: Curved 

	ii. May overrun by 12 pts 

	iii. Char. Space = up to 300%

3. Long

	i. Placement: Curved 

	ii. Try Horizontal First = true 

	iii. May Stack = true 

	iv. Character Spacing = up to 200%

4. Long and Skinny

	i. Placement: Boundary 

	ii. May Place Outside = true 

	iii. Offset = 4 pts 

	iv. Char. Space = up to 240% 

	v. Background Label = true

5. Splotch

	i. Placement: Curved 

	ii. Char. Space = up to 300% 

	iii.Reduce Font from 14 pts. to 10 pts. by 1 pt. increments

6. Snaky or Pronged

	i. Placement: Curved 

	ii. May overrun by 12 pts 

	iii. Char. Space = up to 400%

7. Snaky or Pronged and Skinny

	i.	Placement: Boundary

	ii.	May Place Outside = true 

	iii.	Offset = 4 pts

	iv.	Char. Space = up to 240% 

	v.	Background Label = true
