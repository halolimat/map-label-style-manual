***Map Label Style Manual***

#Names

When we cannot fit the full, formal name of feature we can often label a shorter version.

For example: "USA" is an abbreviation of "United States of America".

For over 3,000 **abbreviations** for general map features and roads, and couple thousand **city nicknames** specifically:

* name_abbreviations/abbreviations.ods
* name_abbreviations/abbreviations.tsv
* name_nicknames/city_nicknames.tsv
* name_nicknames/city_nicknames.readme

#Placements

Once we have a collection of long label and shorter fallback label, we need to actually try placing them on the map.

* geometry_type/linear_feature_label_rules.md
* geometry_type/point_feature_label_rules.md
* geometry_type/area_feature_label_rules.md
* geometry_type/page_layout.md

#Type Styles

Use more than one font face, style, size, and color:

* Tk tk tk

#Tools

We include several python scripts in the `tools` directory for implementing the label and abbreviation logic described in this repo.
